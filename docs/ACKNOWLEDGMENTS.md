Core Inspiration

Shinati-Itanihs (Chiz'yaa) – Ancestral wisdom on balance, resonance, and sovereignty.

Biblical Reference (Luke 17:21) – “The kingdom of God is within you,” guiding the inner feedback loop metaphor.

Two Mile Solutions LLC, Alaska – For research support, practical application, and system testing.

Open-Source and Academic Roots

Taylor & Jonker (1978) – Replicator dynamics foundation.

Eigen (1971) – Quasispecies equation.

Kingma & Ba (2014) – Adaptive learning rates (Adam optimizer).

Åström & Murray (2021) – Control theory fundamentals.

The open-source Python ecosystem (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Plotly, ReportLab).

Community & Collaboration

Contributors and Testers – Everyone experimenting with Trinity Dynamics and offering feedback.

Open Science & Open Source Movements – For setting the precedent of knowledge-sharing without gatekeeping.

Indigenous Knowledge Systems – For grounding the concept of sovereignty, kinship, and distributed trust.



---

Special Thanks

Family & Mentors – For patience, grounding, and lived proof of feedback systems.

Sobriety and Discipline – For showing the principle first in the human nervous system.

Community at Large – For validating that science is not “magic,” but structured observation.
