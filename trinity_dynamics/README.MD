# Trinity Dynamics

**Stability through small corrections (Œ∫/œÄ ‚âà 1.01).**  
A simulation framework modeling distributed feedback systems inspired by nature, human nervous systems, and AI training loops.

---

## üåå Vision
Trinity Dynamics is a research framework from **Two Mile Solutions LLC (Alaska)** exploring how a **tiny correction factor (~1%)** can stabilize feedback systems.  
Just as the human brain balances signals using ~12 watts, this project aims to model **bio-mimetic, distributed stability** for:

- Neuroscience (nervous system regulation)  
- AI Training (gradient descent, RNNs, reinforcement learning)  
- Control Systems (resonance & damping)  
- Human Performance (discipline & flow states)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- **Core simulation engine** for N-agent feedback loops  
- **Œ∫/œÄ correction factor (~1.01)** stabilizes oscillations & accelerates convergence  
- **Metrics module**: entropy, stability, energy efficiency  
- **Sensitivity analysis**: sweeps across parameters & noise  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib + interactive Plotly dashboards  
- **Automated reports**: generates PDFs via ReportLab
